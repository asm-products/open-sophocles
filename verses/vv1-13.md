### OEDIPUS
    Children, Cadmus' brood,
    why sit before me
    in supplication?

    The city reeks of incense,
    stinks of begging and groaning.

    I, children, have come
    to hear it myself â€”
    me, famous Oedipus.

    Old man, you there, speak!
    Tell me why you sit:
    fear or civic love?

    I will help you all,
    pitiable kids.
